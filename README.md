# ProjectMI

A machine intelligence project to define and train a deep learning model using Keras, which will be used for a College of Wooster tour guide chatbot. 

These are some of the key files in the project: 

- `chat.py` - used to set-up the chat feature of the chatbot using the trained NN model.
- `train.js` - define and train a neural network model 
- `intents.json` - intents data used to train the NN model.
